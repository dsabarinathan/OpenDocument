**Open Doc: Real-time document processing libraries**

OpenDoc is an open-source project that provides robust and efficient libraries for real-time document image processing. Our goal is to simplify the process of extracting meaningful information from scanned documents through various image preprocessing techniques. Whether you need to enhance image quality, reduce noise, correct skew, or extract text using OCR, OpenDoc offers a comprehensive suite of tools to meet your document processing needs.

In this repository, we share modules and scripts to help you seamlessly process and analyze document images, making OpenDoc a valuable resource for developers, researchers, and anyone working with scanned documents.

## Document Image Preprocessing Modules

Here are some of the features provided by our document image preprocessing modules:

- **Image Enhancement**: Improve the quality of scanned documents through various image enhancement techniques.
- **Noise Reduction**: Remove noise from document images to make text and other elements clearer.
- **Binarization**: Convert grayscale or color images to binary images for easier processing.
- **Skew Correction**: Automatically detect and correct the skew in scanned document images.
- **Segmentation**: Segment document images into text, images, and other components for targeted processing.
- **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)**: Extract text from document images using OCR technology.
- **Feature Extraction**: Extract various features from document images for further analysis.
